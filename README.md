# 🏦 NixCBS - Simple Core Banking System - Requirements

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to build a **modular Core Banking System**, starting with the **Deposit Module** and supporting future **add-on modules** such as Loan, Transfer, Payment, etc. The system is designed for **high performance**, **zero downtime**, and **scalability**.

---

## 🚀 Functional Requirements

### 🧩 Modular Architecture
- Microservice-based or service-oriented design
- Each module is independently deployable and scalable
- Modules communicate via API Gateway and/or Event Bus

### 💰 Deposit Module
- Account creation (Savings, Current, Fixed Deposit)
- Deposit / Withdraw / Transfer within accounts
- Real-time and end-of-day transaction support
- Interest calculation and posting
- Transaction history and account statement generation

### 🔌 Add-on Module Support
- Pluggable architecture to add new modules
- Event-driven integration (Kafka/Event Grid)
- Dependency and contract management between modules

---

## ⚙️ Non-Functional Requirements

### ⚡ Performance
- Transaction processing latency: **≤ 100ms**
- Simple queries latency (e.g., account balance): **≤ 10ms**
- Must support high-concurrency workloads

### 🟢 Availability
- **Zero Downtime Deployment** via:
  - Rolling updates / Blue-green deployments
  - Health checks and graceful shutdown
- High Availability with multi-region failover (Active-Active / Active-Passive)

### 📈 Scalability
- Horizontal and vertical scaling supported
- Must support growing transaction volume and users

### ✅ Reliability
- Retry mechanisms and circuit breaker pattern
- Event sourcing or Change Data Capture (CDC) for transaction logging
- Full audit trail for all operations

### 📊 Observability
- Integrated monitoring, logging, tracing (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry)
- Alerting system covering all modules

### 🔐 Security
- OAuth2 / OpenID Connect for authentication
- Encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Role-Based / Attribute-Based Access Control

### 🔧 Maintainability & Extensibility
- Clean or Hexagonal Architecture
- Versioned APIs for backward compatibility
- CI/CD pipelines with full test automation and rollback
